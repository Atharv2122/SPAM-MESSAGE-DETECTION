# SPAM-MESSAGE-DETECTION
SPAM MESSAGE DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING METHODS

When it comes to solving time series prediction problems, new methods are being developed that are based on
machine learning and deep learning.It has been demonstrated that these methods yield outcomes that are more
precise than standard regression-based modeling.
It has been reported that Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is significantly outperformed by
artificial RNNs (RNNs) with memory, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).To memorize longer input
data sequences, the LSTM-based models incorporate additional "gates."The main question is whether the LSTM
architecture's gates already provide a satisfactory prediction and whether additional data training is required to
further enhance the prediction.
By traversing the input data twice (left-to-right and right-to-left), bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) enable
additional training.Therefore, the research question of interest is whether BiLSTM performs better than
conventional unidirectional LSTM when it has additional training capabilities.A behavioral analysis and
comparison of the BiLSTM and LSTM models are presented in this paper.The goal is to find out how helpful it
would be to fine-tune the involved parameters with additional data training layers.The
results show that extra preparation of information and hence BiLSTM based demonstrating offers preferred
forecasts over ordinary LSTM based models.More specifically, it was discovered that BiLSTM models
outperform ARIMA and LSTM models when it comes to making predictions.BiLSTM models were also found
to reach equilibrium much more slowly than LSTM-based models.
A spam(Sending and Posting Advertisement in Mass) text is a text message sent to a mobile phone or system
for marketing a particular product or service. Spam messages irritate a lot of people and also memory storage
becomes full because of all these useless messages. Spam may be malicious also which may affect the mobile
or system. Basically In this project, we have used Dense text classifier, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Bidirectional LSTM and compare these methods in terms of performance and runtime to detect if the messages
are either spam or ham from a set of messages, in order to prevent any of the cons from the spam messages.
